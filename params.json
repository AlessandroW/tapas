{"name":"TAPAS","tagline":"a tool for rapid prototyping of adaptive streaming algorithms","body":"TAPAS is an open-source **Tool for rApid Prototyping of Adaptive Streaming control algorithms**. TAPAS is a flexible and extensible video streaming client written in _python_ language that allows to easily design and carry out experimental performance evaluations of adaptive streaming controllers without needing to write the code to download video segments, parse manifest files, and decode the video. TAPAS currently supports _DASH_ and _HLS_ and has been designed to minimize the CPU and memory footprint so that experiments involving a large number of concurrent video flows can be carried out using a single client machine.\r\n\r\nTAPAS architecture is shown in the following block diagram. \r\n \r\n![TAPAS architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldecicco/tapas/master/docs/sphinx/_static/tapas-architecture.png)\r\n\r\nIn order to implement a new controller it is sufficient to create a new controller class, f.i. `MyController`, in a python file placed in the `controller/` directory. The `MyController` class has to inherit from `BaseController` class and implement only a few methods. For an exhaustive description, please refer to the available documentation shipped with the source code and the TAPAS paper (see References section).\r\n\r\n### References\r\nLuca De Cicco, Vito Caldaralo, Vittorio Palmisano, Saverio Mascolo, **TAPAS: a Tool for rApid Prototyping of Adaptive Streaming algorithms**, Proc. of _ACM VideoNext Workshop_, Sydney, Australia, December 2014 ([PDF](http://c3lab.poliba.it/images/f/f3/Tapas-videonext.pdf))\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTAPAS has been written by:\r\n* Vito Caldaralo (@vito105 vito.caldaralo@gmail.com)\r\n* Luca De Cicco (@ldecicco ldecicco@gmail.com)\r\n* Vittorio Palmisano (@vpalmisano vpalmisano@gmail.com)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease contact Luca De Cicco (@ldecicco ldecicco@gmail.com).","google":"UA-57234665-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
